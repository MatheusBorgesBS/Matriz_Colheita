<h2>
  First College Assignment
</h2>
<p>
  This was one of the first assignments I completed for the Programming 1 course. Its purpose was to learn how to use file reading, read a matrix, and return how many days it rained in each month and how many days were appropriate for planting.
</p>
<h2>
  How does it work?
</h2>
<p>
  The given matrix needs to be a 12x30 matrix, with rows representing months and columns representing days. The matrix is composed only of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents sunny days and 1 represents rainy days. A day suitable for planting consists of 1 rainy day followed by two sunny days.
